# MCQM

Three multivariate copula quantile mappings (MCQMs) and one-dimensional quantile mapping (QM) are used to predict bias-corrected values at unvisited locations.
The `MCQM_script.R` in the scripts folder shows how to use the functions and implement MCQM using the example data.
The `example_data.RData` contains mean air temperature at one day obtained from weather stations and ERA-Interim data.
